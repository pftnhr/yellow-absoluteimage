# Absoluteimage 0.9.2

Converts image path to absolute URL

## How to install an extension

[Download ZIP file](https://github.com/pftnhr/yellow-absoluteimage/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and copy it into your `system/extensions` folder. [Learn more about extensions](https://github.com/annaesvensson/yellow-update).

## How it works

Converts

    <img src"/media/images/photo.png" ...

to 

    <img src="https://example.com/media/images/photo.png" ...

Linked images that already have an absolute URL are not affected by this.
